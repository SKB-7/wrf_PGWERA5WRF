# PGWERA5WRF
Software to modify ERA5 files and add a large-scale climate change signal from CMIP6 ensemble. 
Create boundary conditions from ERA5+PGW for WRF.

# Instructions

## Download and organize CMIP6 data

In this section, we download available CMIP6 data at monthly frequency for the periods and the scenarios requested. We also organize the files into folders and check that all the variables are available for all models and over the period requested.

1. Data can be downloaded from [ESGF](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/esgf-llnl/), where login is required. The best option is to use Globus - the use of wget scripts is not very straight forward. You need to impose a series of conditions to get the monthly data that is required by WRF. First it must have both historical and ssp585 (or the desired scenario), then select monthly data, and finally the variables required (hur, hurs, ps, psl, ta, tas, tos, ts, ua, uas, va, vas, zg). You can also select the variant label. Check [CMIP6 Models](#cmip6-models) for a complete list of models that were downloaded. 


2. Once the data is downloaded, it must be organized into folders. We initially organized them into two folders: historical and ssp585. Within those two folders, they are organized into directories for each variable. Finally, the files are distributed in folders for each model (ej: $WORKDIR/historical/va/ACCESS-CM2). All variables files are inside as downloaded from ESGF. An example on how to organize files this way is provided here: [reorganize_CMIP6_folders.py](reorganize_CMIP6_folders.py)

3. Check that all models has a complete set of data ready for PGW processing using [check_completeness_CMIP6_PGW.py](check_completeness_CMIP6_PGW.py)

4. Create a list of the models to process. For example within historical and any of the variable folders: `ls -d *>list_CMIP6.txt`

## Create monthly annual cycles and CC from CMIP6 models

In this section, we calculate means for every calendar months to create files with an "annual cycle" (also called "seasonal cycles"). Then we will make the difference between future and present files for the requested periods to calculate the climate change signal (delta) for every GCM, variable and calendar month. We will create the corresponding netCDF files (one for each GCM and variable). Finally, we will interpolate these netCDF files from the original GCM grid to a common ERA5 grid ([era5_grid](era5_grid)) so that they can be merged together and added to ERA5.

Note: the common ERA5 grid is created from a sample era5 file using:

        cdo griddes era5_daily_sfc_20171130.nc > era5_grid

1. Calculate the annual cycles, calculate the climate change signal (deltas) and interpolate to era5 grid for each model and varaible using [Calculate_CMIP6_Annual_cycle-CC_change-regrid_ERA5.py](Calculate_CMIP6_Annual_cycle-CC_change-regrid_ERA5.py). This script may be edited to select the periods and the scenarios to be processed. It also let you select the models to be processed or use the list_CMIP.txt created above (default). It also takes input and output directories as arguments. Finally you can process one variable at a time by specifying it as an argument. 

Note: the cdo interpolation command wihtin this script was giving an errorÂ  "Unsupported file structure" possibly because of the time dimension, or other variables not supported. The new version of the script fixes this.

Note 2: Once the CC files are created and regridded, MCM-UA-1-0 gives some error because it has some extra variables that need to be removed
Example:
for file in $(ls *_MCM-UA*.nc); do ncks -x -v areacella,height ${file} aux.nc; mv aux.nc ${file}; done

Note 3: Some GCMs provide data up to year 2300 or 2400, which create some problems. We have removed those years and process only until 2100.

2. Then, we create the definitive netCDF files with the climate change signal using [Create_CMIP6_AnnualCycleChange_ENSMEAN.py](Create_CMIP6_AnnualCycleChange_ENSMEAN.py)

    or manually with cdo:

        cdo ensmean ts_* ts_CC_signal_ssp585_2076-2100_1990-2014.nc
